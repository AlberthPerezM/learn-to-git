## How to contribute

### Prerequisites

```
Git installed.
GitHub Account.
A code or text editor (probably you already got it).
Minimal Git understanding.
Minimal HTML understanding. 
```
If you got good links to share to help us to teach the Git basis, please feel free to open an Issue asking for add it!

### Adding your contribution

The first objective of the project it is that you can do your first PR (Pull Request).

To achieve this, many task needs to be performed correctly. But, not the first time necessarily.

Contribute to a project that isn't yours can be overwhelming the first time, and that is fine, this project is made to help.

So keep reading, and try to Add your name to the list! If something goes wrong, you can ask for help.

Made your first PR involves that you:


`Fork` the original repo (This gives you a copy or a "Snapshot" of the code in GitHub).

`Clone` or download your Fork.

`Move` into the project folder and find `index.html`.

You should `edit` this file, adding your `name` and `link` (May be your GitHub Profile) to the list.

`Checkout` a new branch (With a branch, your changes become part of a parallel development road, without touch the original).

`Add` your changes to a "Commit".

`Commit` !

`Push` your commit to your GitHub fork. (This upload your local changes into your copy of the project).



Well done! We almost finish!


(Drum rolls)


Now, you need to propose your changes to be `Merged` with the original repo.

This may be little tricky and need some Pics, so for now, please follow the official GitHub guide.

https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork


And that's all!

If all goes Ok, you need only to wait that your changes be approved and your name will be shown in the project website.


Now go to the streets and yell to the clouds that you just become a Git Jedi Master, an Open Source supporter and a better developer!
